This repository enables the use of Transfer Learning (TL) to enhance Alzhaimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis based on images.  
We recommand to use ADnet (available at https://github.com/rturrisige/3D_CNN_pretrained_model) or its variants in case of MRI dataset. 
Otherwise, ResNet models pre-trained on ImageNet and adapted to 3D processing can be used.
